### Important Terminologies

- Root Account: the AWS account where you have hosted your root domain (e.g. example.com) in a [hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-working-with.html). You should not be working straight out of your root account for this workshop as you might inadvertently compromise your DNS configurations.
- Service Account: the AWS account where you will be hosting and verifying your email domain (e.g. sesworkshop.example.com) to be used for this workshop.

For this workshop, your email domain will be a sub-domain of your root domain. You can follow the steps below to delegate your root domain hosted zone to the service account.

### Create the hosted zones in your service accounts
This will NOT happen in the root account. You will be creating the sub-domains in the service account.

{{% notice note %}}
These hosted zones MUST be **PUBLIC Hosted Zones**.
{{% /notice %}}

The zoneName must be suffixed with whatever you purchased as your root domain. Assuming your root domain is `example.com` the hosted zone name will be something like `sesworkshop.example.com`.

### Create DNS records in the root account
First, go into your **root account**, and then to the Route53 console, and click on the hosted zone that you registered your domain in Route53 with, and get the hosted zone id. It should be a string like: `Z02271753ICPZ8MJC84MI`
![Zone Id](/hugo-ses/images/1/4/0001.png?featherlight=false&width=70pc)

Second, go into your **service account**, and go to the route53 console, and click on the hosted zone that you just created. It should look something like this:
![DNS records](/hugo-ses/images/1/4/0002.png?featherlight=false&width=70pc)

Look at the NS record, and copy the contents of the "Value" field. Now, go back to the root account, and add a NS record for DNS delegation. The value should be the name servers from the **service account hosted zone**.

Once done, your hosted zone in your **root account** should have the NS record like this:
![DNS records](/hugo-ses/images/1/4/0003.png?featherlight=false&width=70pc)

### Check to see if the DNS records resolve
Wait 5-10 minutes after the DNS entries deploy to your root account hosted zone in order to do this check.

Go to your terminal and run `host -a sesworkshop.example.com`.

The output should look something like:

```

As a correctness check, here is what you should see if the DNS records do NOT resolve correctly:

{{%expand "Unsuccessful Resolve Output" %}}

### Relevant Labs
The following labs will require a custom domain:

- [2.2: Domain Identities](../../2-create-domain/2.2-domain-identity)
- [7.3: Optimize Your "Weekly Deals" and "Daily Updates" emails for Deliverability](../../7-capstone-project/7.3-deliverability)
